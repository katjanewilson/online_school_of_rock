"763","I bought my Epiphone G-310 SG about a year ago August 10 but I didn’t bother to learn anything just mess with a bit. My brother recently bought a Yamaha acoustic guitar and I’ve been practicing I want to say from the start of May or the 4 to now the 10th. So from 2018 to now 2019 I’m actually putting more effort into learning at least songs since I don’t know the chords or familiarized with all the frets my hand & fingers aren’t used to it so I keep having to count how many frets down it is. I learned a smaaaaall part of No Matter What by Badfinger and it gave me a lot of joy to get even that really small part down. I came over to this song and I’ve got about 45% percent of it down just not as precise or on tune as I’d like because even though I had my guitar a whole year I’m still new haha I don’t know the guitar 100% like just frets chords and all but I thought if I just learned a few songs I’d get into learning more about the musical chords and basically everything I will need to know to become a better player and have a great understanding of music with a guitar. This video is helping a lot every time I get another little part down I get excited or just feel some happiness inside of me. I love music so much I collect cds I have about 50-60 cds just a music enthusiast. I love everything about music from the break downs to interludes or just drums bass guitar singing I love the complexity and simplicity of music just the over all detail.

"886","Love this. This tutorial is the ONLY reason I have bought a guitar. I saw this randomly in my suggestions and clicked play, the way you played my favourite song and the first few minutes of the tutorial urged me to grab my daughters guitar. 15 hours later I could play the first 10 seconds and I was hooked. I bought my guitar last night for £20 off social media and I'm now another 15 hours in, 30 in total. I can just about play the first 15/20 seconds with saw finger tips. I'm 31, never picked a guitar up but now my daughter and I have something awesome to take on for good. For now I can only watch your YouTube clips but be assured I will join and watch all your other tutorials as I progress so this may be the only thing you see from me but just wanted to say you have some serious teaching skills and I'm hooked. Not to mention a massive THANK YOU i struggle with things sometimes and this effects my family life so having this to share with my daughter you've actually helped in fixing a hole in our life.

"1099","When it come to the 7h8s5 you have to let the 7th note ring a bit more than the other notes. Like your holding off from doing the hammer on to the 8th until the very last moment. Like holding back.

The same is to be done with the 0h5 on the B string before you do the harmonics at the end of the first half of the intro.

You can clearly hear he's holding off a bit before he does either hammer on. The first time he does it really gives that slide a bit more class. Beautiful.",NA,NA,"Roger Louttit"

Question: Consider striking the fifth and sixth string on the guitar simultaneously creating E and A notes. Is the interval, or distance between those notes a fifth or a fourth?
     Answer: Both.... man.... that's right Daddyo, time for you cool cats to realize that just as in quantum mechanics experiments, the observer's intent seems to affect the atomic particles, just like the musician's decision on how he wants to view the sound of the fifth and six strings played together actually changes the reality of that sound in the minds of whoever is mentally viewing it that way.

Why that part 7:12 is different from the one you teached in the lesson in your other channel   GuitarJamz   , which one is the correct one to do ? 
 instead of shifting the finger from you just slide from 5 to 2 on the high E and then open  E.
because i struggle to produce the sound you make on this lesson.

also i have an electric guitar that had been in the case for a while it is recommended to change strings for better sound ? 

by the way can i ask you why you needed to open a new channel ?
what's wrong with the old one XP ?

"1521","I'm a beginner. Only been playing for almost 2 weeks now, and I have the hardest time getting my slides and hammer on's to sound out on my acoustic. Is that just a general problem with acoustics. I can consistently get either a slide or a hammer on by itself to sound out, but it's always a very faint sound, and if I try to add onto that the string just gets muted. Am I not hitting the string hard enough for it to still be ringing. Am I not sliding / hammering on fast enough? I guess it might be kind of hard to tell what I'm doing wrong without actually seeing it lol.","hard",NA,"Bangalorius"

You tryna dethrone me from spot on number one

When I'm through with you we're gonna be completely fuckin' done
'Cause we only just begun, I review you *clap clap* zero, bye bitch, gone
So come on T-Series, looking hungry for some drama
Here, let me serve you bitch lasagna

I got nine-year-olds of worlds so hold your defecation (Oops)

"2114","I post up here on Matry's page as there is a chance people see it. I am closing in on 1 year in (I am 65) here are my beginner tips/warnings. First the warnings. No matter how many times you read in the comments to do so, do not practice excessively. People are told when they say ""my finger tips are still sore,what is the problem"" People tell beginners ""you need to practice more"" When people say ""I am having trouble with the ""C"" chord and barre chords, what is wrong with me"" People are told to practice more. Wrong. Your body and brain need healing time and repair time. You can move into extended practice after you have developed good form. What I mean about good form is. Finding out that you do not need to grip the neck so tight,finding out you do not need to press the strings so hard and using good form to get that straight down finger position on the strings. Excessive practice before your mind and body are ready can lead to burn out and more likely problems like tendonitis and carpal tunnel issues. Last, get the best sounding and easiest playing guitar you can afford, go out on a limb here. There is a trade off realized with simply lowering actions.","hard",NA,"Dan R"

"2285","Try adjust your posture, maybe bring the neck up to make it easier to move your hand around it. Possibly change where your thumb is and your wrist should be in line with the neck your hand should be in front of the neck to allow you to press in with your fingers. 

But honestly if you’re really new to learning it can just be that finger tip skin can be soft and takes a few days to harden and get used to the grips. 

Just keep trying it honestly all is just in repetition. 

Another thing to check is that the neck of the guitar is straight and properly in line. If it has been knocked out slightly as this can cause strings to catch on incorrect frets.","hard",NA,"Will"

I was bored during quarantine, so I started looking through old boxes and found 4 things: a bass guitar, an acoustic guitar, a pick, and a capo. Then, I thought this: “I’m gonna stay inside of my house for two weeks constantly, so why don’t I give a shot at learning?” After that, I looked on YouTube and found Marty Music. I got an ad at the beginning about A website called Guitar tricks. I wanted to get to the video so I skipped the ad and despite of what the guy said, YouTube was very helpful for me. I played my first song this morning. It was a song called Wonderwall by Oasis, and I was able to play it after a week of learning from Marty.

If I had to guess, I would say that your guitar might not be in tune. You might also be pressing the strings in the wrong spots. It's hard to say what the exact problem is without seeing it or hearing it, but those are some possibilities.  


Keep in mind that you don't need to apply tons of pressure to get a note to ring out. Only apply as much as is needed. You'll figure out what that is in time. Also, keep in mind that beginner guitar players don't sound good when they start. It takes time to get good and sound good. I hope this helps.","hard",NA,"Something To Consider"

"2616","Just want to say thank you so much for these lessons.  In June of 2018 I was brutally attacked at my place of work. I was a hostess at a restaurant. I suffered many severe injuries not to mention PTSD, post Concussive disorder, anxiety, insomnia, and depression. I've have had surgery and I'm in therapy 4 days a week. I paint and therapy is helpful but progress is slow.  

My husband knew that I could read sheet music and that music always seems to help me. On February 1st 2020, he surprised me with a beautiful acoustic guitar. He said it was an early Valentine's day gift. I picked it up and havent put it down since.  I practice everyday. I've learned the first 4 chords you taught me, and yes it's been painful but worth every note. 

This music, learning, my guitar, all of it has begun a healing, it's created a peace that i haven't felt in nearly two years.  

I'm in love with it. So thank you. Playing has pulled me out of a very dark place.  It's saved me.  I begin just to strum away and the world goes quiet and there's peace where the was stress. Named her Shelby❤ God bless you Marty God bless you",NA,NA,"Michelle Espinoza"

*""As a completely new person to instruments, how long should I be practing each chord?""* - You can move on to a new chord when you feel like you have a decent understanding of the chord you were practicing. That could take a few days or a few weeks. It depends on the person. What I did when I learned these chords ages ago was I learned a bunch of them all at once. I practiced them in conjunction with other guitar exercises and got them over time. That's probably not the best advice for a beginner, but that's what worked for me. Also, don't worry about how long it takes to learn or practice something. If you subject yourself to maybe 30 minutes of honest practicing everyday, then you will see improvement. There's nothing wrong with you if it takes you 2 months to learn something someone else learned in 1 month. Just keep at it, practice honestly, and you will get better. I hope this helped :)",NA,NA,"Something To Consider"

"2966","First off, I know nothing about acoustic guitars. 

My first dilemma is that I can't decide whether I should get an acoustic ""Yamaha"" in mid prize range or go for ""Taylor GS Mini"" or don't even bother with anything expensive at all and just simply get an acoustic guitar for around $200 to $300.

There are two opinions which I agree with both to a degree.

First one: Don't get an expensive acoustic guitar because you don't know you're going to stick to it.

Second one: Get a good acoustic guitar (which doesn't mean you need to spend over a thousand. Maybe something like ""Taylor GS Mini"") so that it inspires and motivates you when you hold it and try to play it.

I went to a music store yesterday because I was so pumped up about getting myself  an acoustic guitar. 

The person at the store was very nice and showed me how to press some notes. And I tried out pressing some notes on different acoustic guitars for about half an hour. 5 minutes into it, I could not press on the strings hard enough because the strings were digging into my finger tips. And I was like, ""Maybe I should step back and think again if I really want to get myself an acoustic guitar...!?!!?""

And, right off the bat, I guess my biggest hurdle is that my palm ""naturally"" presses against the back of the neck like I'm grabbing the neck of the guitar, rather than my palm being open and off the back of the neck. I keep doing the same mistake because
1- I guess I'm trying to hold the neck in place so that it doesn't move around much when I press hard on the strings
2- I can't seem to press the strings hard enough if I don't get a support from the back by ""grabbing"" the neck, but...... when I grab the neck, then my other fingers touch the other strings. I guess I have to practice, practice and practice and don't give in to ""frustration"".

I mean, I would love to learn how to play acoustic guitar, but my first attempt was intimidating and discouraging. Maybe I was pressing on the strings a bit too hard. I don't know!?!?!

I mean, since I tried it, myself,  and know that it is not as easy as it look, how is it possible that this guy presses on the notes and bends the strings like this? Does he have ""superman"" fingers or the acoustic guitar he has something to do with it? Or is he on coke or what? What am I missing here? If David Gilmour of Pink Floyd heard this guy play, I think he would be like, ""holy shit!!!""
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRqjOuhZsoY

How about this? I don't know if this will start at 1:38 of the video below as I intended. If it doesn't..., forward it to 1:38 where he starts playing the ""Terminator Theme"" on a 12-string acoustic guitar. As soon as I hear the first notes, starting at 1:48, I get goose bumps. Absolutely amazing!!! 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnU2kGGyalE&feature=youtu.be&t=98

Watching and hearing things like these, I get crazy about learning how to play an acoustic guitar, but I guess I have to be a bit realistic.

I signed up for lessons from a guy in Harlem, a 45-minute commute from Brooklyn.  Took one lesson, practiced some, went back for the second, and DAMN! my fingers hurt.  I didn't go back after the second lesson.  Didn't care for the teacher, didn't like the 45 minutes commute.  That guitar has been sitting in the corner of my last three offices.  Today, I decided to pull it out, tune it and try again.  I played through this lesson and DAMN! my fingers hurt :-).  However, I am going to try and take this guys advice and come back for 5 minutes a day for a month or so and see where it goes.  I DO HAVE ONE SERIOUS QUESTION THOUGH.

I need time off and told my friend Jamie I'm going to.

So she asks what I'm going to do?

She suggested golfing and I almost spit the water I was drinking out of my mouth.

Thankfully it didn't come to that ; )

I told her I need to start something easy and fun and thought to play and sing more music.

So she told me about this channel - and it's given me new ideas. I'm going to start practicing piano soon too.

AND...if all goes well...I'm going to bring my friends together and who knows, maybe even start a weekend band.

I'm glad you found a way to practice that works for you. Learning the guitar is no easy task, but it's something everyone can do. 


*""I wish I had started this when I was young!!!""* - Age doesn't matter necessarily when learning the guitar. You may have more time to practice when you're younger, but it's possible for adults of any age to start learning. You can't be too old to learn!",NA,NA,"Something To Consider"
"3020","@Something To Consider 
From practicing, my fingertips are numb and still hurts at the same time. My fingertips started to harden though!!! :-)

Here, some intro info first! 


We have conscious  and subconscious mind. Both conscious and subconscious mind cannot be in the foreground (in charge, active) at the same time. When one is ""active"", the other one is passive. When we can get our subconscious mind to work for us, we achieve ""miracles"". We're the puppets of the puppeteer. The puppeteer is the subconscious mind, programmed by the accumulation of ""knowledge"" or ""garbage"" ever since our first day in life. And it's running our lives from cradle to grave through our moods, habits, fears, worries, etc.


For a short period of time, right after you wake up, for about 5 to 10 minutes, sometimes 10 to 15 minutes (depending on the person), the subconscious mind is in the foreground. That's the perfect window of opportunity to practice ""what you want to learn"" so that it goes straight into your subconscious mind without the negative criticism and the rejection of your conscious mind. 

It is NOT what you say, but what you FEEL that programs your subconscious mind more than anything. When you feel, ""Shit! I can't get this right no matter how much I practice. I don't think I can ever learn (or do) this"", then you will never be good enough. Your subconscious mind will make sure that there will always and always be something in your way to sabotage your progress because ""through your feelings"", that's what your subconscious mind is programmed to do.

Sorry for the long postings! I can't seem to post anything short. But without any background information, things won't make sense to the reader if the reader is not familiar with the topic. 

Anyway, what helps me tremendously more than anything is to practice with my acoustic guitar as soon as I wake up (even before I wash my face) when my subconscious mind is in the foreground. 

Within that small window opportunity of 5 to 10 minutes, I only spend my time, practicing ""what I struggle with"". 

At first, getting all my 3 fingers jammed together (without blocking the other strings) and at the same time, pressing all 3 strings hard enough for the A major chord were almost impossible, but now it is easy.

I wish I had started this when I was young!!!","hard",NA,"TheOuttabody"
"3021","TheOuttabody, 


*""The essence of my question (if you will...) is: what is the sign I should look for, in myself, to know for sure that I'm ready for the next tutorial video?""* - Well, it depends on what chord you're trying to learn. By the way, I'm assuming that you're going through Marty's beginner course and not someone else's. Marty starts by introducing the Em and Asus2 chords. They are generally regarded as the easiest chords to play on the guitar. Since neither one of these chords are very difficult, you could probably move on to the next lesson in maybe a week or so. Marty then introduces the A chord in the next lesson, which is more difficult than Em and Asus2 in my opinion. It could take maybe 2+ weeks to get a feel for that chord. Instead of worrying about how much time to spend learning each individual chord, just move on when you feel semi-comfortable with said chord. You won't master these chords for quite some time, so it would probably be best to focus on building your chord vocabulary without worrying about perfection. Try to do this in an organized fashion so the information you learned won't fade away like you mentioned earlier. (Also, don't ask me how to organize this information! When I learned all these open chords, I just crammed them all together and got them over time. This method was easier for me, but it probably wouldn't be for most people!)


*""If it's okay to bother you from time to time with my short trivial questions, what's your email? If not..., I absolutely understand. No biggie! :-)""* - I don't mind if you send me a question from time to time, but it would be best if your question was sent in this comment chain we have created. Also, keep in mind that I may not be able to answer all of your questions. I have been playing guitar for quite some time, but I'm not some technical master or anything! I just wanted to point that out. All the best!","hard",NA,"Something To Consider"
"3022","@Something To Consider As always, I appreciate your help and replies. 

Your analogy makes perfect sense. And I can relate to it as it relates to many things in my life. You're good, my friend.

My next question: in the video, he says, ""practice at least for 5 minutes a day"" which is the least we, as a beginner, can do before jumping the gun and saying, ""I can't do it. I am not good enough. This is not for me!"".

I understand that it's up to how much I practice a day at a time and also it is up to my progress, but ""in general"", how much time (how many days or maybe even weeks) should I spend on the first video tutorial before moving on to the next? 

I just want to give each tutorial its worth before moving on to the next so that I don't have to keep coming back to the first or previous lessons because... when I put ""more and more"" new lessons on top of the previous ones, the knowledge and the practice from the previous lessons seem to fade away, if you know what I mean...

The essence of my question (if you will...) is: what is the sign I should look for, in myself, to know for sure that I'm ready for the next tutorial video?

"3023","TheOuttabody, 


Congratulations on purchasing your first guitar! It can be quite the chore to figure out which guitar to buy, especially if you haven't done it before. To answer your question about the Em chord, you can finger the chord or any chord however you'd like. You're allowed to modify chords as long as the essence of the chord is preserved. Basically, the chord still has to sound correct. Beginners are taught shapes in the beginning because they are easy to remember and refer to. It is step one of a multi-step process. Eventually, instead of relying on just the shapes of the chords, you will understand the individual notes you're playing that make up said chord. This is important for many different reasons, but I don't want to confuse you with too much information. Guitar playing is like a puzzle. In the beginning, you have very few pieces to work with and nothing seems to connect. As you advance, you start acquiring more and more puzzle pieces and concepts start to connect. It then becomes much easier to understand what the full picture is supposed to look like. I hope that analogy made sense! I'm not very good at wording things, but hopefully you got the main idea!",NA,NA,"Something To Consider"

"3029","Kip B, 


Honestly, I don't think it really matters. Even though your son is left handed, he could still learn how to play a right handed guitar. I would invite you to consider taking your son to a guitar store and have him try out both playing orientations. When your son tries out both playing orientations, have him go off of what feels most comfortable to him. I would presume that your son has no experience playing the guitar, so the feel of the instrument is all he'll have to go off of. You and your son can then move forward from that point. I hope this helped :) 


SIDE NOTE - Even though I said I don't think it matters if your son plays left or right handed, I would encourage him to learn how to play right handed. Most guitar players play right handed and most online resources are offered from right handed guitarists. Playing right handed is just more common and may be easier to follow for that very reason. There is, however, nothing wrong with playing left handed. It's up to the player, but if they can't decide and or don't care, then I think they should learn how to play right handed.",NA,NA,"Something To Consider"

Your videos are helpful don’t get me wrong but I think a lot in the beginning is just the person figuring out what works for them. For example on this E minor cord I would mute the 4th string even tho my figures were rounded. Turns out it has to do with the ring and pinky finger, they are to be in a very special position for the cord to sound right. I came to this conclusion because I have watched this video about 20 times in this past week and I just could not get the E minor cord to work properly every single time.

Well, having tension in your fingers is an issue that everyone has at some point. If the tension isn’t in the fingers, then it’s somewhere else in the body. In general, the best way to get rid of tension is to relax or be relaxed. It sounds simple I know, but you can’t possibly be under loads of tension if you’re relaxed. In the case of your fingers, it is always a good idea to stretch your hands and fingers out before you start playing. This helps to get the blood flowing and also helps loosen your hands and fingers. It is also a good idea to stretch and massage your arms before you play as they are a key part in playing the guitar. A good rule of thumb is to spend around 5 minutes stretching before you start playing. Also, don’t worry if you can’t get rid of your tension right away. It is a problem that even advanced players have a hard time dealing with. If you feel like you’re about to tense up, then stop, reevaluate your technique and try again. 


You also mentioned that you’re having trouble creating the right amount of pressure on the strings. Again, this problem isn’t unique to you and is something everyone has struggled with at some point. This is one of those things that you will get over time, but I’ll still give you a little tip to help you out. It is important to keep in mind that you should only use as much pressure on the strings as is necessary to make the note ring out. If you use too much pressure, then you run the risk of hurting your fingers as well as pushing the note sharp. If you don’t use enough pressure, then it is likely that the note will not ring out at all. A good way to figure out how much pressure to apply to the strings is to slowly put pressure on a fret until you hear the correct note come to life. For example, go to the 3rd fret on the 6th string and slowly apply more pressure until you hear the correct note ring out. Once you hear the correct note, you can then memorize how that felt and recreate it later. You can do this on any fret and string by the way, I just used the 3rd fret on the 6th string as an example. I hope this helped :) 


P.S. You will develop calluses over time as well. Once they are developed, it will be easier to fret notes! All the best!","hard",NA,"Something To Consider"

It is hard for me to provide specific information without seeing and playing the guitar, but I can provide some general advice that should point you in the right direction. For the most part, everything you would pay a guitar tech to do you can do on your own. It's only the advance, more precise work that you would want a professional to do, especially if you were dealing with a super expensive guitar. In your case, I would invite you to consider doing the following to your guitar: change your strings, make sure the intonation is set up correctly, make sure the action is set properly, adjust the truss rod if needed (some guitars don't have one), clean and condition the fretboard, (only condition an unfinished fretboard, like a rosewood fretboard for example), and polish the body. There are tutorials all over the internet that go over how to make the aforementioned adjustments to your guitar. After these basic adjustments are made properly, you can then say you have a decent guitar on your hands. There is so much more you could do, but these adjustments are essential to any guitar to get it to look, play, and wear properly. I hope this helped :) 


P.S. Don't forget to condition your fretboard if it is unfinished. It will prevent the wood from drying out and will make the fretboard look new again.","hard",NA,"Something To Consider"

Well, it could be a combination of old age and you doing something wrong. If you're a beginner, your playing isn't going to sound very good no matter the instrument. It's not your fault or anything, but you have no prior knowledge of anything guitar related. It makes sense that you wouldn't be able to play very well. Now, I would highly recommend getting a new guitar. If the guitar you're trying to play/learn on collected dust for 4 decades, then it obviously needs to be checked out or replaced. Even if it sat around for a year or so, it would still need to be checked out. I would invite you to consider taking your guitar to a guitar technician to be evaluated. From that point, you can determine if you want to fix your current guitar or buy a new one all together. I hope this helped :)",NA,NA,"Something To Consider"

Well, I would invite you to consider going to a guitar store and trying out all the acoustic guitars they have. It may seem like a lot of work, but it will be worth it in the end. With that being said, I would say that the Taylor GS Mini is a solid acoustic guitar to start with. While it isn't the cheapest acoustic guitar for beginners, it isn't super expensive either. It is also smaller than a regular acoustic guitar as the name suggests. A smaller guitar may be easier for a beginner to get used to, especially if said beginner is on the smaller side. 


According to Guitar Center, the Taylor GS Mini starts at $499. There are also several electric-acoustic versions available ranging from $649 to $799. These numbers are as of September 17th, 2019 as that is today's date. I would imagine that the $499 version would be more than enough for you as a beginner if you were interested in the Taylor GS Mini in the first place. I hope this helped :)

I learned some but it was a couple of years ago. I would like to learn how to play it but im worried if its like one of those ""Oh i wanna do this"" and then do it and the next week lose interest over it. Thats my main worry. I do have a friend who could give me lessons and let me practice on one of his guitars. The only thing is he plays by ear so he doesnt know how to read music.

"3275","Leah Waite, 


I would recommend that you cut your fingernails if you're interested in playing the guitar. Your nails on your strumming hand don't need to be as short as the nails on your fretting hand, but they both shouldn't be too long. In the case of Dolly Parton, I had to do some research to figure out some information to provide you with as I am unfamiliar with most of her work. What I learned from my 5 or so minutes of research is that Dolly mostly used open tunings while playing. Also, she would usually play just the root notes of chords, which made playing the chords much easier. Dolly was unable to play the chords on her fingertips as it was impossible to do with super long nails. You just can't play on your fingertips if you have really long nails. There are definitely ways to manage it, but anyone serious about their guitar playing will cut their nails down. With that being said, if you're interested in fingerstyle guitar, then you should consider keeping a decent fingernail length on your strumming hand as it could make fingerpicking easier for you. Your fretting hand should still be cut down though. I hope this helped :)",NA,NA,"Something To Consider"

There are many different ways of playing the same chord. In this case, I wouldn't worry so much about what Google is telling you. Google is a great resource, but it can be confusing for beginners who don't have much experience with music or guitar playing. I would focus on playing the chords the way Marty is showing you in this video. To answer the second part of your question, you do strum all six strings while playing an E minor chord. By the way, the chords Marty is showing you in this video are E minor and Asus2, not Esus2. I hope this helped :)",NA,NA,"Something To Consider"

The above link is for a video that helps beginners learn how to tune their guitar. In the video, Erich plays every string on the guitar so the viewer knows what each string is supposed to sound like. All you have to do is match the sounds you're hearing from the video with the sounds you're hearing from your guitar. For example, when Erich plays the low E string (the thickest string) all you have to do is tune your low E string until it sounds the same as Erich's. Once that happens, you're done! Just repeat the same steps for every string and your guitar will be in tune. I hope this helps :)",NA,NA,"Something To Consider"

"3284","Nicky E, 


I'm glad I could help! As a side note, it seems like learning for free online is the best option for you based off of your goals. I'm not sure how much guitar experience you have, but I would say that your guitar goals should be achievable in about 6 months or so with regular practice (assuming that you have little to no experience with the guitar). When I say 'regular practice', I mean at least 45 minutes of actual practicing everyday. You don't have to practice 45 minutes all at once, but it is a good place to start. Good luck on your guitar playing journey! If you run into a wall, don't give up. Guitar is a very difficult instrument to play, but anyone can do it with the right mindset. Take care :)","hard",NA,"Something To Consider"

"3286","Nicky E, 


What you end up doing doesn't matter as much so long as you continue to practice. I will say, however, that you will probably learn faster with a paid service or online course. Paid services/courses tend to have more organization present, which allows students to better understand what to learn next. Also, tracking your progress with a paid service/course may also be easier. Of course, I am just generally speaking. I would invite you, and anyone else, to consider developing a practice routine and sticking to it. The bottom line is that you need to practice regularly in order to see any improvement. It sounds like an elementary concept, but so many people neglect any type of practice and wonder why they don't get any better. 


With regards to free online resources, you would probably learn slower unless you practiced regularly. Learning by yourself allows for more room to get lazy. This is because there is nothing kicking you in the butt to keep going. Also, learning off of YouTube allows you to choose exactly what you want to learn. There are definitely some baseline skills that every guitar player should have, but a lot of what gets taught from paid services/courses is unnecessary for most. It depends heavily on what your goals are on the guitar. Additionally, YouTube and most free online resources tend to be much less organized than paid services/courses. This may lead to confusion and perhaps a feeling of being overwhelmed. 


Ultimately, the decision is up to you. Keep in mind that essentially everything you will pay to learn can be learned online for free. The main differences are the levels of organization with content, the rate at which you will learn, and having someone present to guide you should you choose courses with guitar instructors. There is no right or wrong decision as there is a lot of subjectivity embedded within your questions. Maybe you could try out paid services and free services in order to see what you like better. I hope this helped and didn't bore you to death! :)",NA,NA,"Something To Consider"

So, I figured, heck, I will watch lesson videos on YouTube, and take in whatever I can online and from literature, so I can teach him myself...at least until I can afford professional lessons. There are many ""beginner guitar lessons"" on YouTube, but somehow it feels like the instructor is teaching the audience as if they have some experience already, and know their way around a guitar. Many of them don't even mention the notes of the strings before they jump into teaching the chords. True beginners are not familiar with the musical alphabet as far as guitar goes. The only thing I know is from school choir: ""Every Good Boy Does Fine."" Your mnemonic, ""Eddie Ate Dynamite, Goodbye Eddie,"" is excellent. It is the first one I've heard that someone can remember instantly. It really sticks. You really start from the basics, even naming the parts on the guitar. You mention the importance of calluses on the fingers and even show the proper way to hold the pick! For anyone, who, like myself and my son, learn best through knowing every little detail of how something works before we can understand it, your lesson style and empathy is greatly appreciated.

There are different ways of fingering the same chords. In the case of E minor, it usually comes down to personal preference. Some players prefer to play an E minor chord with their first and second fingers, while others prefer to play an E minor chord with their second and third fingers. Also, depending on what song you're playing, it may be easier to finger chords differently to allow for smoother transitions. For now, I would invite you to consider getting comfortable with open chords. Later on, it will be easier for you to modify chords to allow for smoother transitions if need be.

I was not confident in it, and remember seeing the look on his face when i did not want to continue playing the next year. that is still stuck in my head. My wife know how close me and my dad is now that i am 35 years old, so she bought me a acoustic guitar for x-mas last year. I am really wanting to learn to play, so that i can actually sit down with my dad and play a song together. The reason i do not go over and learn and jam with him, is because i live in Oklahoma (took a position here), and he lives in Alabama.

I just didn't want it to sit in a corner and collect dust. Now I am rethinking purchasing one to help keep my mind right. It may just be that therapeutic thing I need. Only told my cousin today.

This one video has given me the confidence to jump in. If they're all as easy to understand as this one, I have no doubts I am the next...well..the next guy who can play songs around the campfire I guess but still!

"4039","Thank you :) :) .. I learned guitar in primary school then stopped, moved to clarinet then excelled on sax in high school. 10+ yrs ago I fiddled on bass guitar (was told ""fingers here, fingers there"".. no theory or knowing what chord I was playing). I've bought a beautiful Yamaha APXT2 recently, perfectly suited to my small hands.. and I've just loved this lesson. I've had a rough year health wise, and after a few surgeries & dark times I was looking for something to make me happy & give me a focus & hobby that would satisfy my soul. I love my new guitar! I'm so excited about getting music back in my life.. it's therapeutic & I've thoroughly enjoyed this re-introduction to tunes. I'm now about to turn 41 & most of what I learned previously is lost. This vid was great! I love my new guitar :) :D",NA,NA,"Bec Fos"

"4041","So here is a story for you.  I am 52 years old and all my life I have told myself every reason possible why I couldn't learn and play guitar.  Recently a relative died and as a member of the family I was invited to go along and help clear the house.  In a store room at the back was a case, and inside the case was a guitar.  Written on the guitar was the words 'Fender Stratocaster Made in America'.  I decided that something so beautiful could not be thrown away so I asked if I could take it and brought it home.  At first I thought it is bound to be ruined.  It dates back to the 70s and is purple coloured so I started to look on youtube about how to clean it.  It looked beautiful!  After that I thought that I maybe might like to hear it and so I looked for other videos about how to tune it.  I found your video which mentioned apps, and so I downloaded one onto my phone and tuned it.  Then I found this video a week ago.  I clumsily picked out the two chords but I did what you said and picked the guitar up every day and also started to play with moving my hand up and down the fret board.  Gradually my left hand started to relax which made it more comfortable and I started to hit the finger placements without looking.  Marty you have sold me on this thing and tomorrow I am taking on your next lesson.  At the age of 52 I have decided to learn guitar and my first guitar is a Fender Stratocaster.  Go figure.  I wanted to thank you for making tuition accessible for me and feel free to dine out on the story if you find it amusing.  I guess now I need an amp.  Nothing too big, just something to plug this baby into to see how she is meant to sound.  I will be checking out your gear vids for tips.  Currently I found a VOX headphone plug that mimics something called an AC30.  Through my headphones it sounds great but now I am wondering what an amp will do to it.  I guess you have started me on a journey for which I thank you greatly.  All the best.  Aaron.",NA,NA,"Aaron's allotment"

"4204","Marty, I don't know if you're still reading these comments, but my wife is following along wanting to learn a bit of guitar.  When she tries to stum she bends her wrist and reaches with her fingers to do so.  I kept trying to get her to keep her wrist straight, but to no avail.  I finally went and got one of  her wrist braces and have her wearing it on her right wrist.  She is now holding the proper wrist posture to strum.

Thank you for these lessons.  I, myself, am relearning the guitar because I haven't played since I in the military in the early '70's and these lessons are quickly bringing back some guitar memories, such as muscle memory.

Thank  you again,
Dave from Grand Junction, CO",NA,NA,"Dave Hetherington"

My Dad was a gifted player, my Mom can play, my sister can play, and while I can hang somewhat with percussion, I've never come close to figuring out guitar.  I can't even properly maneuver a plastic rock band guitar and instead play it on my lap, like Jeff Healey!  My hands are small and weak, which makes it difficult to wrap it around the guitar head properly, and I've never been able to get the strumming rhythm.  I don't know if I was channeling my Dad, but something just clicked tonight and I was able to just get these two chords, like I've owned them my entire life, with zero effort, thanks to your easy breakdown.

I stepped aside saying one day menso. Like so many of the comments I see, I came across your estacion. I respected you from the first words you said. I figured out a way I wish a teacher would of taught me. And you are passing on your teaching, Gracias. I was handed a guitar pick at an event, first sign that came, picking up the guitar and strumming, ugly, you suggested picking up a pick for beginners, I picked up a range of them, made all the difference. I am now into your third video, and like anything I do, if I am going to jump in, going into head first.

"4623","From an absolute beginner:

I love these lessons from Marty! I tried a few times in life to learn guitar. Private lessons, recorded lessons, whatever...didn't work for me. I'd always end up learning single note stuff from nursery rhymes. Which only made the good stuff seem so impossible to reach. Since struggling with even the nursery rhymes bruised my ego beyond repair.

When I decided to give it a try from YT videos. I watched a lot of different beginner videos before deciding on who I would follow and learn from.

Here's why I chose Marty:

1. Clear and detailed instructions. He covers everything you see and hear. And doesn't assume you know any of it yet. Or gloss over things you see him do with little detail on how he did it.

2. A huge series of videos! I didn't want to get comfty learning from one instructor only to have to find another later and maybe relearn or even be taught differently from another when the 3 or 4 videos the instructor I found were all he ever did for beginners.

3. You learn stuff you won't mind playing from the very first lesson!

4. The way he presents it to you leaves you feeling more confident that you can achieve your dreams of playing well in a short amount of time. I couldn't believe after just a few lessons how many chords I already understood. 

Of course I'm still very new. I suck at transitioning between chords and am just starting to be able to understand strum patterns. But I can already piece together stuff that somewhat resembles songs I know! 

I don't mind the mistakes because I know I'm progressing and getting better! 

Awesome series for beginners!! Feel truly blessed to find Marty's videos!! 

Thank you so much and keep up the good work Marty!!",NA,NA,"GlockisBeast2617"

"4631","QUANTUM GUITAR!?
Question: Consider striking the fifth and sixth string on the guitar simultaneously creating E and A notes. Is the interval, or distance between those notes a fifth or a fourth?
     Answer: Both.... man.... that's right Daddyo, time for you cool cats to realize that just as in quantum mechanics experiments, the observer's intent seems to affect the atomic particles, just like the musician's decision on how he wants to view the sound of the fifth and six strings played together actually changes the reality of that sound in the minds of whoever is mentally viewing it that way.

"5045","Here is a pro poor tip if you dont own a Capo grab a zip tie and dont hate on me im broke 😫 
Ps the meaning of this song refers to a hotel in Iowa that has a mini bar that only had Vodka and no Gin and the ice machine was broke at which point everyone got high and watched care bears for 12 straight hours and the check out time expired in the middle of the marathon at which point they murdered the hotel guy i know it got dark real quick im just explaining it to you dont blame me ok so the rest of the song is loosely related to the inflation of lava lamps due to the death of jimmy hoffa who was killed by the Men in black because he created a Union for Aliens who just happen to be the ones who wrote the guitar solo for the song at which point the songs finnal lyrics are completely based on the fact they put sterilizing drugs in Fruity pebbles. .....your welcome 😄

I didn't played it at all since I gave up with chords.

Playing smoothly between chords
Going up and down with the pick

Those two are major problems.

Up and down routine, got it.

I have been playing for only a few years but I have 2-3 people that I generally like to learn from on the internet and you are at the top of that list ( since I practice every single day from 2-3 hours, that is saying a lot!)!  Thank you for the great tutorials.  One of these days when I have some money (I'm recently handicapped so money is scarce) I will definitely sign up for your courses - You have not only a good ""attitude"" but also a great way of teaching - I don't know what it is but your tutorials are the best I've come across!!!

The only decent lesson he’s done is Sweet Home Alabama. My friend was learning the guitar and came in to school saying he could play Hotel California, and I wanted to see. Then he pulls out this shitty chord progression that is completely off key from the original. I asked him who he learnt it from and of course he says fucking Marty","hard",NA,"AlphaSlingshot"

"5895","I started trying the intro tonight based on the chord progression in your lesson.   It was kind of mechanical at first but had the right sound and I was pretty excited.  But after sitting and playing around with that part over and over until my left hand would no longer respond.......I figured out how much I could do with just down and up strums to get the sound of the real song.   I was amazed and very pumped.    Thanks Marty.   I've been learning guitar for 9 months now on my own without ""in person"" lessons.  You've been a big part of that progress from the start.   Incredibly rewarding hobby even for a 49 year old man.   Truly enjoying it.   Thanks for all you do.

It’s one of this worlds most iconic song and it’s really easy to learn.  My biggest advise I can give is when someone says it’s easy to learn please do confuse that with mastering the song. They are worlds apart. Learn the song first. Then play it over and over and over again till you have mastered it. So many people hear. “It’s so easy and they struggle. The cords are easy.

"6191","Great tutorial, ""A"" standard like many of your others. Without a doubt you are one of the best teachers on the web at the moment. Thank You !  One very small piece of constructive criticism.... In some of your breakdowns you miss some small but crucial info without which it doesn't quite sound ""like your's"" when I play it.  In the case of this breakdown, it's the Am walk-down in the chorus. You spell out the strings&frets  to finger-pick, but what you actually play in the video is a little more complex.  You are clearly finger picking those notes, but a the same time you appear to be throwing in some small strums. So it sounds like both the rhythm of the strumming is being maintained during the walk-down, but also a solo finger-picking is being played. You may not even realize you are doing it.",NA,NA,"Richard M"

I've been strumming chords for ages and  was getting bored and frustrated that unless I had another instrument or someone singing, the songs never sounded any good on their own.

"7290","Long time lurker and long time subscriber (to both of your youtube channels).  I really enjoyed your cool story of meeting John Denver.  Strangely, as a fan of rock music, I really love John Denver's music.  I realize some hate his music, but I set collegiate powerlifting records after working out to his music; which cleared my mind.  I realize you get thousands of requests, but is there any way you could do a reasonably easy tutorial to his song ""This Old Guitar""?  I am just not good enough to learn how to play by watching the few videos of him playing that song.  Also, it doesn't help that he seems to change it up in live performances vs the studio version that is stuck in my head.  Even if you have absolutely no intention of ever doing a tutorial on this song, I still really appreciate what you do; from a father of 5 who never even picked up a musical instrument until I was given a old guitar when I was 53 years old.

BTW, the vocal melody is the same. If you find a beginner piano book with that song you'll probably find what you're looking for. Plus, Marty doesn't do lessons on vocal melodies, at least not that I've seen over the past several years of following him, though I haven't seen every lesson.",NA,NA,"Grumpy Old Man"

Whenever I seek out how a song is played I hope it's one that you've posted.  And I'm posting on this video because it was the first song I learned to play on guitar thanks to you.  I do have a request:  'Killing Time' by Triumph.  It's a underated song that comes after an A cappella tune called Time Cannon on the Thunder Seven album.  There's very limited info online on how to play this song, it seems to have fallen through the cracks.  Anyway, once you hear it, I'm sure you'll agree it's one to be added to the collection.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQEaoHvGoN0",NA,NA,"Brian"

Since then I have followed several other online instructors as well as taken one on one lessons locally before finding this man.  After just a couple of his video lessons, I am convinced Marty Schwartz can teach a blind man to see.  His detailed, methodical approach just makes learning the guitar easier and more enjoyable.

"8221","I love YouTube.  First started playing in the 70's. I'm  not great, or a rockstar, but when practiced up do sound pretty decent I must say.   Back in my day, we'd often have to catch songs when they aired our favorite stations and write down a few more of the lyrics and progressions'  sometimes for years.  I kept spiral notebooks full of ""in process ""  songs.  Always has been a progressive, meditative  tool & and good friend most my life.    Coolist thing is many of my renditions were ""close""  and now with  the advent of the internet I have, and still do to this day, rework more accurately those old masterpieces. Wow!  I never new until a year or so ago that Kashmire was so beautifully simple.  Sounds great. These lessons have helped me tremendously, to keep my one true love alive. What a friend-  at the beach, campfires,  parties, biker events, parks, downtown sidewalk benches (Romeo, Mich),  family events, the list goes on and on, and on and on (it's a highway song...)    Guitar has always helped me to easily feel part of the scene, to fit in, rather than be just a spectator.  Made raising my three kids more fun too! Come on! Daddy taking the kids to the park, yeah, the beach!  Can easily watch babies all day if I got a guitar to jam on.   And women?  Has served me well.  Better than a puppy, or even Jack  Daniels!  (Eventually turning to 12 steps,  of course.  Shhhhh.)        Right on!!  (I'm 60)  
Mentally. Spiritually. Socially.  It's like working on your own  personal, lifelong puzzle.  It also taught me humility- to not try to be better than you, rather to continuously be better than  ""me"". I assure you I've run into 16 year olds who after two years of playing blow me away with a natural God given talen,way beyond what I will ever achieve, much less possess... Jealous?  Never.   Respect. Appreciate! Happy for them.

Anyway, I was browsing YouTube for lessons and stumbled upon your channel. I can already play a piece of ""Sweet home Alabama"" and now I'm learning this intro. I can only say you are a legend!

When I felt more comfortable, I looked up how to play Franklin's Tower and found you. I've been practicing Franklin's every day for at least four weeks, and still don't have the rhythm quite right. I thought this tune sounded pretty simple, but damn does it look tough! It'll be my next challenge for a couple weeks. Thank you so much for these videos man.

"9201","Good ears! He's only doing all 6 strings on some of the downstrokes for emphasis.  Try experimenting with hitting just the high 2, 3, or 4.  If you search youtube you can find David Gilmour on acoustic guitar, might be useful for comparison.  ""David Gilmour Wish You Were Here live unplugged"" - check out the 12 string player, it's pretty close to what Marty does.",NA,NA,"John Shalamskas"
"9202","John Shalamskas I don’t understand what strings he’s strumming in the intro when he goes up and down is it all six. Like when he strums down on the G chord then goes back up I get lost",NA,NA,"Tx Niinja"
"9203","He makes it easy for beginners to play along with their favorite songs.  Nothing wrong with that!

Great vid and tuition,  BUT as Rodger said ""I remember this well , I was messing about on a 12 string I had just bought from a friend , and some one said, hey , what's that ?"". 
That's really good,  and Dave Gilmour said , ""maybe I can do something with that "" ,
And , as they say, the rest is history!

I feel like moving two fingers to transition from Dsus4 to A7sus4 is more difficult for me than just adding one, but I'm not sure if there may be a specific reason the index finger should be used in Dsus4-- is it leverage?

1) Days Of The New - Shelf In The Room...fantastic guitaring with an acoustic guitar and 
2) Limp Bizkit - Walking Away...several repeating chords (hopefully easy enough) and Wes Borland's amazing guitaring and chorus.

Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
